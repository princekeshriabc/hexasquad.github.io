        REVERSE SWING
    </h1>
    <p>
        <center class="prince parag">The earliest recorded instance of reverse swing dates back to the 1940s in club
            cricket in Lahore, Pakistan. Pakistan’s Saleem Altaf during the late 1960s and early 1970s and legendary
            Australian pacer Dennis Lillee in mid and late 1970s were believed to be fine exponents of “swing bowling
            with the old ball”. However, reverse swing was mostly an unknown art till late 1970s, practised by only a
            few, who too had developed it only via trial-and-error methods.

        Sarfaraz Nawaz of Pakistan was one of the earliest and finest performers of reverse swing. He is said to have
        passed on the knowledge to his captain, Imran Khan. They also noticed that they could use the dry pitches of
        Pakistan to good effect to reverse swing the ball. </p>

        Later on, Pakistan also produced two more greats of reverse swing in Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis. The two
        formed a devastating fast bowling pair which wreaked havoc all around the world, with reverse swing being the
        chief weapon in their arsenal. While Pakistan were clearly leading the way as far as reverse swing was
        concerned, the rest of the cricketing fraternity started developing their own methods to extract reverse swing
        by the mid 1990s as well. By 2000s, the term “reverse swing” was coined and the whole world had acknowledged and
        accepted it.

        Just like any other new theory in practice, reverse swing has had its fair share of obstacles as well. For a
        long time, the practitioners of reverse swing were accused of cheating. Over the years, the perception of the
        world towards reverse swing has changed and now it is seen as a skill rather than being seen as a dark art. But
        still, there have been several instances where teams have used foreign objects like Vaseline, Brylcreem, wax or
        tried picking the ball using bottle caps, knives or nails and even bit the ball in order to “prepare” the ball
        for reverse swing. The infamous sandpaper-gate from the 2018 Australia-South Africa series is one of the most
        recent and standout events of that kind.

        As the name suggests, in reverse swing the ball swings in a direction opposite to that of conventional swing.
        When delivered at high speeds, the ball starts to swing against the direction of seam. That is called reverse
        swing. The beauty of reverse swing lies in the fact that a predominantly outswing bowler can bowl inswingers and
        conversely a predominantly inswing bowler can bowl outswingers as well, without changing his grip or bowling
        action.

        In reverse swing, the flow is turbulent on both sides – due to roughness on the non-seam side and due to high
        speed on the seam side. Hence, if the non-seam side is roughed up or the ball is delivered at very high speeds,
        the laminar boundary layer becomes turbulent almost immediately, more importantly before reaching the seam
        location. The seam has a detrimental effect on the turbulent boundary layer by making it thicker and weaker
        because of the high speed and separates relatively earlier compared to conventional swing. But due to an earlier
        separation on the seam-side, as opposed to conventional swing, the pressure gradient would now flip. There is
        more turbulence on the non-seam side, higher airspeed and hence by the Bernoulli’s principle, lower pressure.
        This results in switching of the asymmetry and consequently the side force in comparison to conventional swing.
        This would mean that the air pushes the ball towards the non-seam side leading to reverse swing.

        It is easier to achieve reverse swing if the non-seam side is roughed up to achieve turbulence at lower speeds.
        In other words, if the ball is tampered or scuffed up then reverse swing can be achieved at lower speeds. Even a
        new ball can be reverse swung but only when delivered at very high speeds. And if one continues to bowl at such
        high speeds, he will get only reverse swing and never get conventional swing. This means that the fastest
        bowlers in the world will produce reverse swing even when the ball is new. So, is it impossible for
        comparatively slower bowlers i.e., the ones who bowl below the critical speed to make the ball reverse swing?
        Certainly not. That is where the roughness of the surface comes into the play. As the roughness on the side of
        the ball facing the batsman is increased the critical bowling speed limit for reverse swing is reduced. And
        hence, reverse swing is achieved.
    </p>

        One of the most common misconceptions about reverse swing is that it occurs due to an imbalance of weight
        between the two sides of the ball. But it is one of the most baseless opinion that has no scientific proof to
        itself at all. The perfect condition for a ball to perform reverse swing is when one side is very smooth and
        other is very rough. The condition of the upper surface behind the seam of the ball is not very critical. But as
        it turns out, there is another advantage of creating a contrast in roughness of the surface of the ball.
